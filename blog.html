                <h2>Biggest Mistake of My Life!🤦‍♂️</h2>
                <p>When I was in 12th grade, I made the biggest mistake of my life. In a moment of anger, I did something that led me to the police station for the first time. I just hope that none of you ever make such a mistake in your life!</p>

                <h2>First day of my Collage😊</h2>
                <p>When I came to Indore, I was very happy because it was my first day of college. So, I woke up at 6:00 am in the morning, took a bath, and got ready. My college started at 8:30 a.m., but it took about an hour to reach there from my room. So, my brother and I went by bus in the morning — and when we got on, we saw that the bus was so crowded there wasn’t even space to stand properly.....</p>

                <h2>How i start coding😂</h2>
                <p>When I came home during my first-year vacation, I didn’t have a laptop. So, I used to just sleep at home for almost two months. One day, my father said to me, “Why are you wasting your time like a fool all day?” His words really hurt me. After returning to Indore, I bought a laptop and started studying online through PW Skills.</p>
