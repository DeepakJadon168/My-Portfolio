         <h2>Biggest Mistake of My Life!🤦‍♂️</h2>
                <p>When I was in 12th grade, I made the biggest mistake of my life. In a moment of anger, I did something that led me to the police station for the first time. I just hope that none of you ever make such a mistake in your life. 
                    This is what happened: I was sitting in Gaurav sir’s coaching class with my best friend Dharmendra — we were both on the second bench. There was a girl who kept making comments about the teacher and cracking jokes in class. For some reason, she touched my leg from behind and then started arguing. I complained to the teacher, but the girl wouldn’t listen and kept talking back. The teacher scolded me and made me sit down, yet she still didn’t back off. During the coaching break she came to pick a fight and started abusing me, so I raised my hand against her.

She then went to the police station and made false statements against us. After that I apologized to her to end the matter because I wanted to stay away from fights and from girls. But I hope none of you ever do anything like this in your life.</p>
