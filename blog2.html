            <h2>First day of my Collage😊</h2>
                <p>When I came to Indore, I was very happy because it was my first day of college. So, I woke up at 6:00 am in the morning, took a bath, and got ready. My college started at 8:30 a.m., but it took about an hour to reach there from my room. So, my brother and I went by bus in the morning — and when we got on, we saw that the bus was so crowded there wasn’t even space to stand properly.Then we reached the college by bus. After that, my brother dropped me off at the gate and left. As soon as I entered the college, I was surprised — I had never seen such a big college in my life! Then I searched for my classroom and went inside. The good thing was that I was the one who opened the class — meaning, I was the first to arrive. I introduced myself to all the teachers, and all the faculty members were very nice. In that class, I made a friend named **Devendra Kalmodiya**, and later, I went home with him.
